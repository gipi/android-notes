``build/core/main.mk`` looks for all the ``Android.mk`` in the AOSP using the command

```
$ build/tools/findleaves.py --prune=out --prune=.repo --prune=.git . Android.mk
```

Inside ``build/target/board/Android.mk`` is called the AndroidBoard.mk of the target device by

```Makefile
-include $(TARGET_DEVICE_DIR)/AndroidBoard.mk

```

We have only to know that ``TARGET_DEVICE_DIR`` is defined as

```Makefile
TARGET_DEVICE_DIR := $(patsubst %/,%,$(dir $(board_config_mk)))
```
